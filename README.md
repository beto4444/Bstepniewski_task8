# ML_basic_example
Welcome to my realisation of MLE task. Below is the short description how to run this task locally or using Docker.

## Prerequisites
Tu run this model you should:
1. Download and install Docker Desktop
2. Clone this repo on your local storage
3. <b>Generate data - to do this run data_generation.py script</b>
4. Run train and inference program - there are two ways to do this: Locally - simply start train.py file, and AFTER THAT run.py file

OR

Via Docker - use below commands:

Training:
The training phase of the ML pipeline includes preprocessing of data, the actual training of the model, and the evaluation and validation of the model's performance. All of these steps are performed by the script `training/train.py`.

1. To train the model using Docker: 

- Build the training Docker image. If the built is successfully done, it will automatically train the model:
```bash
docker build -f ./training/Dockerfile --build-arg settings_name=settings.json -t training_image .
```
- You may run the container with the following parameters to ensure that the trained model is here:
```bash
docker run -it training_image /bin/bash
```
Then, move the trained model from the directory inside the Docker container `/app/models` to the local machine using:
```bash
docker cp <container_id>:/app/models/<model_name>.pickle ./models
```
Replace `<container_id>` with your running Docker container ID and `<model_name>.pickle` with your model's name.

##### Inference:
Once a model has been trained, it can be used to make predictions on new data in the inference stage. The inference stage is implemented in `inference/run.py`.

1. To run the inference using Docker, use the following commands:

- Build the inference Docker image:
```bash
docker build -f ./inference/Dockerfile --build-arg model_name=<model_name>.pickle --build-arg settings_name=settings.json -t inference_image .
```
- Run the inference Docker container:
```bash
docker run -v /path_to_your_local_model_directory:/app/models -v /path_to_your_input_folder:/app/input -v /path_to_your_output_folder:/app/output inference_image
```
- Or you may run it with the attached terminal using the following command:
```bash
docker run -it inference_image /bin/bash  
```
After that ensure that you have your results in the `results` directory in your inference container.
